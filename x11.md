# X11

Only tested successfully in `x86_64`.

Build:

    ./run -x

We don't build X11 by default because it takes a considerable amount of time, and is not expected to be used by most users.

Inside QEMU:

    startx

Not sure how well that graphics stack represents real systems, but if it does it would be a good way to understand how it works.

## X11 ARM

On ARM, `startx` hangs at a message:

    vgaarb: this pci device is not a vga device

and nothing shows on the screen, and:

    grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log

says:

    (EE) Failed to load module "modesetting" (module does not exist, 0)

A friend told me this but I haven't tried it yet:

- `xf86-video-modesetting` is likely the missing ingredient, but it does not seem possible to activate it from Buildroot currently without patching things.
- `xf86-video-fbdev` should work as well, but we need to make sure fbdev is enabled, and maybe add some line to the `Xorg.conf`
