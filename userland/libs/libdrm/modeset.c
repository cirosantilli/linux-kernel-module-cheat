 * DRM Modesetting Howto
 * This document describes the DRM modesetting API. Before we can use the DRM
 * API, we have to include xf86drm.h and xf86drmMode.h. Both are provided by
 * libdrm which every major distribution ships by default. It has no other
 * dependencies and is pretty small.
 *
 * Please ignore all forward-declarations of functions which are used later. I
 * reordered the functions so you can read this document from top to bottom. If
 * you reimplement it, you would probably reorder the functions to avoid all the
 * nasty forward declarations.
 *
 * For easier reading, we ignore all memory-allocation errors of malloc() and
 * friends here. However, we try to correctly handle all other kinds of errors
 * that may occur.
 *
 * All functions and global variables are prefixed with "modeset_*" in this
 * file. So it should be clear whether a function is a local helper or if it is
 * provided by some external library.

 *     /dev/dri/card0
 *     /dev/dri/controlID64
 * We only need the first one. You can hard-code this path into your application
 * like we do here, but it is recommended to use libudev with real hotplugging
 * and multi-seat support. However, this is beyond the scope of this document.
 * Also note that if you have multiple graphics-cards, there may also be
 * /dev/dri/card1, /dev/dri/card2, ...
 *
 * We simply use /dev/dri/card0 here but the user can specify another path on
 * the command line.

 * After opening the file, we also check for the DRM_CAP_DUMB_BUFFER capability.
 * If the driver supports this capability, we can create simple memory-mapped
 * buffers without any driver-dependent code. As we want to avoid any radeon,
 * nvidia, intel, etc. specific code, we depend on DUMB_BUFFERs here.

 * As a next step we need to find our available display devices. libdrm provides
 * a drmModeRes structure that contains all the needed information. We can
 * retrieve it via drmModeGetResources(fd) and free it via
 * drmModeFreeResources(res) again.
 *
 * A physical connector on your graphics card is called a "connector". You can
 * plug a monitor into it and control what is displayed. We are definitely
 * interested in what connectors are currently used, so we simply iterate
 * through the list of connectors and try to display a test-picture on each
 * available monitor.
 * However, this isn't as easy as it sounds. First, we need to check whether the
 * connector is actually used (a monitor is plugged in and turned on). Then we
 * need to find a CRTC that can control this connector. CRTCs are described
 * later on. After that we create a framebuffer object. If we have all this, we
 * can mmap() the framebuffer and draw a test-picture into it. Then we can tell
 * the DRM device to show the framebuffer on the given CRTC with the selected
 * connector.
 *
 * As we want to draw moving pictures on the framebuffer, we actually have to
 * remember all these settings. Therefore, we create one "struct modeset_dev"
 * object for each connector+crtc+framebuffer pair that we successfully
 * initialized and push it into the global device-list.
 *
 * Each field of this structure is described when it is first used. But as a
 * summary:
 * "struct modeset_dev" contains: {
 *  - @next: points to the next device in the single-linked list
 *
 *  - @width: width of our buffer object
 *  - @height: height of our buffer object
 *  - @stride: stride value of our buffer object
 *  - @size: size of the memory mapped buffer
 *  - @handle: a DRM handle to the buffer object that we can draw into
 *  - @map: pointer to the memory mapped buffer
 *
 *  - @mode: the display mode that we want to use
 *  - @fb: a framebuffer handle with our buffer object as scanout buffer
 *  - @conn: the connector ID that we want to use with this buffer
 *  - @crtc: the crtc ID that we want to use with this connector
 *  - @saved_crtc: the configuration of the crtc before we changed it. We use it
 *                 so we can restore the same mode when we exit.

 * Now we dig deeper into setting up a single connector. As described earlier,
 * we need to check several things first:
 *   * If the connector is currently unused, that is, no monitor is plugged in,
 *     then we can ignore it.
 *   * We have to find a suitable resolution and refresh-rate. All this is
 *     available in drmModeModeInfo structures saved for each crtc. We simply
 *     use the first mode that is available. This is always the mode with the
 *     highest resolution.
 *     A more sophisticated mode-selection should be done in real applications,
 *     though.
 *   * Then we need to find an CRTC that can drive this connector. A CRTC is an
 *     internal resource of each graphics-card. The number of CRTCs controls how
 *     many connectors can be controlled indepedently. That is, a graphics-cards
 *     may have more connectors than CRTCs, which means, not all monitors can be
 *     controlled independently.
 *     There is actually the possibility to control multiple connectors via a
 *     single CRTC if the monitors should display the same content. However, we
 *     do not make use of this here.
 *     So think of connectors as pipelines to the connected monitors and the
 *     CRTCs are the controllers that manage which data goes to which pipeline.
 *     If there are more pipelines than CRTCs, then we cannot control all of
 *     them at the same time.
 *   * We need to create a framebuffer for this connector. A framebuffer is a
 *     memory buffer that we can write XRGB32 data into. So we use this to
 *     render our graphics and then the CRTC can scan-out this data from the
 *     framebuffer onto the monitor.

 *     memory-map via mmap() and every driver supports this. We can use it for
 *     unaccelerated software rendering on the CPU.
 *   * We can use libgbm to create buffers available for hardware-acceleration.
 *     libgbm is an abstraction layer that creates these buffers for each
 *     available DRM driver. As there is no generic API for this, each driver
 *     provides its own way to create these buffers.
 *     We can then use such buffers to create OpenGL contexts with the mesa3D
 *     library.
 * We use the first solution here as it is much simpler and doesn't require any
 * external libraries. However, if you want to use hardware-acceleration via
 * OpenGL, it is actually pretty easy to create such buffers with libgbm and
 * libEGL. But this is beyond the scope of this document.
 *
 * So what we do is requesting a new dumb-buffer from the driver. We specify the
 * same size as the current mode that we selected for the connector.
 * Then we request the driver to prepare this buffer for memory mapping. After

 * connect each new framebuffer to each selected connector for each combination
 * that we saved in the global modeset_list.
 * This is done with a call to drmModeSetCrtc().
 *
 * So we are ready for our main() function. First we check whether the user
 * specified a DRM device on the command line, otherwise we use the default
 * /dev/dri/card0. Then we open the device via modeset_open(). modeset_prepare()
 * prepares all connectors and we can loop over "modeset_list" and call

 *
 * But printing empty black pages is boring so we have another helper function
 * modeset_draw() that draws some colors into the framebuffer for 5 seconds and
 * then returns. And then we have all the cleanup functions which correctly free
 * all devices again after we used them. All these functions are described below
 * the main() function.
 *
 * As a side note: drmModeSetCrtc() actually takes a list of connectors that we
 * want to control with this CRTC. We pass only one connector, though. As
 * explained earlier, if we used multiple connectors, then all connectors would
 * have the same controlling framebuffer so the output would be cloned. This is
 * most often not what you want so we avoid explaining this feature here.
 * Furthermore, all connectors will have to run with the same mode, which is
 * also often not guaranteed. So instead, we only use one connector per CRTC.
 *
 * Before calling drmModeSetCrtc() we also save the current CRTC configuration.
 * This is used in modeset_cleanup() to restore the CRTC to the same mode as was
 * before we changed it.
 * If we don't do this, the screen will stay blank after we exit until another
 * application performs modesetting itself.

 * modeset_draw(): This draws a solid color into all configured framebuffers.

 *
 * The color calculation can be ignored as it is pretty boring. So the
 * interesting stuff is iterating over "modeset_list" and then through all lines
 * and width. We then set each pixel individually to the current color.
 *
 * We do this 50 times as we sleep 100ms after each redraw round. This makes
 * 50*100ms = 5000ms = 5s so it takes about 5seconds to finish this loop.
 *
 * Please note that we draw directly into the framebuffer. This means that you
 * will see flickering as the monitor might refresh while we redraw the screen.
 * To avoid this you would need to use two framebuffers and a call to
 * drmModeSetCrtc() to switch between both buffers.
 * You can also use drmModePageFlip() to do a vsync'ed pageflip. But this is
 * beyond the scope of this document.

/*
 * I hope this was a short but easy overview of the DRM modesetting API. The DRM
 * API offers much more capabilities including:
 *  - double-buffering or tripple-buffering (or whatever you want)
 *  - vsync'ed page-flips
 *  - hardware-accelerated rendering (for example via OpenGL)
 *  - output cloning
 *  - graphics-clients plus authentication
 *  - DRM planes/overlays/sprites
 *  - ...
 * If you are interested in these topics, I can currently only redirect you to
 * existing implementations, including:
 *  - plymouth (which uses dumb-buffers like this example; very easy to understand)
 *  - kmscon (which uses libuterm to do this)
 *  - wayland (very sophisticated DRM renderer; hard to understand fully as it
 *             uses more complicated techniques like DRM planes)
 *  - xserver (very hard to understand as it is split across many files/projects)
 *
 * But understanding how modesetting (as described in this document) works, is
 * essential to understand all further DRM topics.
 *
 * Any feedback is welcome. Feel free to use this code freely for your own
 * documentation or projects.
